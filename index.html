        Everybody has his or her own hobby. For me, my favorite hobby is playing music and of course, listens to music as well. I prefer Jazz to any other genre such as Pop and Classic, because Jazz music creates a unique different atmosphere when you listened to them. It gives you the feeling of relaxation and has many unexpected tunes that actually very nice to hear from a song, which made me interested and curious to learn it. My love of music began in the first year of my elementary school. Of all musical instruments that exist, I was most interested to guitar. Beside that, I also love to sing. Doing these two activities is the most enjoyable moment of my life. Back then, I was living with my cousinâ€™s family, there were 2 families living in a big house. One of my cousin is a was learning keyboard but when he grew up he stopped, when I saw him playing his keyboard, I got interested and asked my mother to teach me the simplest technique how to play a guitar. In a week period, I was able to play 1 simple song perfectly and I was so happy. Since then, I became more interested to music especially guitar. I decided my self to take a private lesson to improve my guitar skill when I was 8 years old. As I grew older, I spent most of my time in any activity or situation that relate to music. I enjoyed very much the time when I sat alone at my room played a song and sang at the same time. It brought me such a great pleasure for myself, relaxed my mind, gave new inspiration and many other unexpected things, for example inspiration to write my own song. Playing the guitar has been the most rewarding hobby of mine. As a child and a beginner in guitar playing, I began playing for my parents. As I continue to learn, people started taking notice of my ability to play this instrument.
